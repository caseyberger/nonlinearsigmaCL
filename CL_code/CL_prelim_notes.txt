CL_prelim Branch Notes

4.2.2024
- created new branch
- created CL library + header to do complex dot and cross products
- Open questions:
    - Should I create a special CL class that does complexification and can handle complex variables?
        - How much should that class do? 
            - Should it take derivatives? 
            - Should the user have to program in their own action, drift function etc?
            - Maybe it should inherit the action and drift function and just implement the evolution?
        - Where do I define the complex variable operations, etc? In this class, or a class that inherits this one?

TO DO
- finish cleaning up the new CL.cpp and CL.h and test out:
    - creating just a simple, small lattice with complex fields
    - performing a complex dot product and a complex cross product
    - printing the results to a file
